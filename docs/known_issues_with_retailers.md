# Known issues with some retailers

### Nordiskarum

- The category breadcrums on a product page only point to the homepage, not the actual category of the product. See [this](https://www.nordiskarum.se/mexico-matbord-o140-svart-alu-teak.html) for example.
  Therefore it's quite difficult/require custom logic to map products with categories.
  Currently no solution yet.
